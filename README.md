## Background
Current dedicated breast PET approaches all miss the base of the breast, the axilla, and can only scan one breast at a time. In order to overcome these deficiencies and maximize performance, allowing new research in molecular breast imaging (similar to the intent of
Total-Body PET in whole body imaging, we propose a completely new geometrical scanner configuration to maximize geometric sensitivity. The key performance characteristics include:
* Imaging of both uncompressed pendant breasts, the chest wall, and axillary regions with PET and with MRI
* A high sensitivity and high resolution detector system using depth-of-interaction (DOI) and time-of-flight (TOF) techniques to achieve      high signal-difference-to-noise ratio (SDNR)
* High geometric sensitivity across the FOV to exploit either highresolution and high-SDNR, or low dose PET imaging
* Integration with an MR breast coil allowing the dedicated breast PET system to be compatible with any MR device
* inherently co-registered PET and MRI data allowing for fine spatial localization, attenuation & scatter corrections, as well as
  joint reconstruction
* Modular design, allowing removal of lateral detectors for standard breast immobilization and MR-guided biopsy
